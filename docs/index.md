    excerpt:
      Legolas, short for **L**arge **E**igensystem **G**enerator for **O**ne-dimensional p**LAS**mas, is a novel
      finite element code tailored to MHD spectroscopy of 1D Cartesian/cylindrical
      equilibria with flow that balance pressure gradients, enriched with various non-adiabatic effects.

    excerpt:
      Legolas is written in object-oriented Fortran (2008 standard) with a complementary Python framework (Pylbo)
      used for post-processing, data analysis, interfacing and parallel running. Both source codes are extensively
      documented and we provide a detailed guide on how to get started with the code.

    excerpt:
      We are happy to answer any questions you may have in using Legolas and/or Pylbo. Feel free to open an issue
      in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/n-claes/legolas) or start a [Discussion thread](https://github.com/n-claes/legolas/discussions)
      there. We also have a dedicated Slack workspace, which you can also use to ask questions or have a nice chat with the developers.
      You can also just send us an e-mail.

what_legolas_can_do:
  - image_path: /assets/images/example_suydam.png
    excerpt:
      Legolas can do a multitude of things, ranging from full spectrum calculations to eigenfunctions
      of specific modes, to full-on parametric studies of various equilibrium configurations in different geometries.
      You can take a look at all the various [equilibria](/general/equilibria/) that are already implemented, or read
      more on our About section.

using_legolas:
  - image_path: /assets/images/history.png
    excerpt:
      Legolas is the result of months and months of development and testing. Since this takes a lot of effort and time,
      we kindly ask that _**the first published peer-reviewed paper from applying Legolas is done in co-authorship with at least
      one of the original authors**_. Since the code is brand new we would like to know how it is used and provide guidance if possible.
      Additionally, if you use Legolas in a publication we kindly request that you cite our paper.
