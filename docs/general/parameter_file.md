The Legolas parfile allows for a full customisation of all Legolas variables, and most of these have default values.
Legolas explicitly inspects your equilibrium for nonsensical values and will warn you if something is not right.
Whenever the code catches something during its inspection phase it either logs a warning and continues running, or
exits with an error depending on the severity of the issue.

You can create the parfile manually using this guide, or let Pylbo take care of generating one.
More information on generating parfiles with Pylbo can be found [here](../../pylbo/legolas_interface/#generating-parfiles).

## gridlist
This namelist includes all grid-related variables.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
**Warning:** For cylindrical geometries we override the start value with $r = 0.025$ if it is initialised
with zero. Some matrix elements scale with $1/r$ and may become very large when $r \rightarrow 0$, resulting in very large elements which may throw off some solvers.
Note that the matrix elements and equilibria are evaluated in the _Gaussian_ grid, the first point of which may be very small but will never be exactly zero. <br><br>
Setting `force_r0 = .true.` in the gridlist forces the `r = 0` condition, but this is not recommended.

## savelist
This namelist includes all variables related to data output.

{% capture notice-info %}
**Note:** Legolas uses a logging-based system to write information to the console, similar to Python's logging module.
The level of output is controlled through the integer `logging_level`:
* **level 0** : only critical errors are printed, everything else is suppressed.
* **level 1** : only critical errors and warnings are printed
* **level 2** : prints info messages, warnings and critical errors (default)
* **level 3** : (or higher) prints debug messages in addition to all of the above
{% endcapture %}

## paramlist
This namelist handles constant parameters which are used in the equilibrium prescriptions, This is meant to be used in parameter studies, for a comprehensive list of all
the possible parameters we refer to [this page](../../ford/module/mod_equilibrium_params.html) in the
Legolas source code documentation. To see which parameters are used in which equilibria, take a look
[here](../equilibria/).

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
**Note**: setting a variable with the paramlist does **NOT** automatically include it in the equilibrium configuration. For this to have any effect you have to _use_ that
variable in your submodule as well. For example, if you never set a magnetic field in your submodule and never use the `cte_B02` variable,
setting `cte_B02 = 1.0d0` in the paramlist will have no effect. Take a look at the different equilibria to see which parameters are supported.
